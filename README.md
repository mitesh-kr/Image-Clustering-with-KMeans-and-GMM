# MNIST image clustering using KMeans and GMM

This assignment involves implementing K-means clustering with cosine similarity and PCA with GMM clustering on the MNIST dataset. The objective is to explore unsupervised learning techniques and analyze their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this assignment is the MNIST dataset in CSV format 
available at:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv

## Tasks 1: K-Means Clustering

a.) Implement K-means clustering from scratch using cosine similarity as the distance metric.  

b.) Perform clustering with 10, 7, and 4 clusters.  

c.) Visualize clustered images.  

d.) Comment on cluster characteristics.  


## Task 2: PCA and GMM Clustering

a.) Implement PCA from scratch (except SVD) and perform GMM clustering.

b.) Apply PCA for 32, 64, and 128 components.

c.) Perform clustering with 10, 7, and 4 clusters.

d.) Visualize clustered images.

e.) Compare results with Task 1 and discuss observations.
